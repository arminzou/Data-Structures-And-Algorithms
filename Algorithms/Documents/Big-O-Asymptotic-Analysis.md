## Big O Asymptotic Analysis

### What is good code?

1. Readable - write readable clean code that others can read that is maintainable
2. Scalable
   > - Speed (time complexity)
   > - Memory (space complexity)

**Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs** <br>
**Data Structures**: Ways to store data <br>
**Algorithms**: Functions or ways to use data structures to write the program <br>

**Heap**: Where we store variables that we assigned values to
**Stack**: Where we keep track our function calls
